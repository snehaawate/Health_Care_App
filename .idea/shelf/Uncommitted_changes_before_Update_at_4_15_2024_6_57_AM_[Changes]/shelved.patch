+# Health_Care_App
+
+1.	INTRODUCTION :
+      1.1	Overview
+      The Application is used to keep users aware about their Health status, maintain a Good Lifestyle in Day-to-Day Life.
+      1.2	Purpose
+      Users can get a clear overall idea about their Health Status, take care of themselves without any dependency on others. The App has a lot of useful modules with a user-friendly interface.
+2.	LITERATURE SURVEY :
+      2.1	Existing problem
+      As the Country is populated, it is important to make resources available to people in an easier way. The Medical Industry is one of the critical factors of a Country. A Lot of people are unaware about how a poor Lifestyle can have impacts on their health in the Future. A lot of Medical Related Applications are available in the Market, but they target only a certain Department like Medicine Order, Doctor Consultation, what if we can bring all the Features within a Single Application.
+      2.2	Proposed solution
+      Thus, we propose Health Medicare App, an All-in-one Medical App, to solve all the Problems related to Health and Lifestyle. We will include all the Required features from Meditation Tracking to Doctor Consultation and Medicine Order. For now, we have done only 7 Modules including User Registration.
+3.	THEORITICAL ANALYSIS :

+
+4.	EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS :
+1)	User Registration / Forgot Password / Login: We have to analyse which Database to use, so that it can store user’s information properly. Also, it has to be stored in the Cloud as well as User’s Device. So, we used both Room Db and Firebase Realtime Database to store Login Credentials. User Login Details in separate Table and Medical Details in another Table.
+2)	Dashboard: To display user’s information on Successful Login in the Dashboard, we used Room Db. We give the User Email Address, to fetch all the user Related Details from the Database and reflect it back.
+3)	Calorie Manage Page : Collecting the Details from the User. Calculating all the Calorie Data in the Background, and displaying back to the user.
+4)	  Health Article : We used (An Open-source API) to Load the Health Articles. We did research on finding the Best API to integrate within the App with proper architecture.
+5)	Sleep Tracker : We did some analysis on how to capture current Timestamp in a variable, convert them into Date, find difference, and display back to the User.
+6)	Map Search : We did some research on how to integrate Google Maps into an Android App. Also, how to display the Nearby hospitals at a given Location.
+7)	Emergency Dial : We did some research on finding all the important HealthCare Toll free numbers in the Country, how to integrate Messaging and Call option directly. We used Intent to successfully transfer the Mobile number.
+8)	OTP (Forgot Password) : We used SMS-Manager to directly send OTP to the user’s Mobile Number.
+9)	Daily Reminder Notifications : We are using Google Firebase Cloud Messaging to send Automatic Scheduled Notifications to all the users.
+10)	Permissions : We ask user SMS, Notification Allow Permission.
+11)	5.	FLOWCHART :
